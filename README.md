# Task Tracker (Drupal 8)

This is a task tracking site where you can assign and check progress of tasks.

## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar) 
for your setup.

After that you can clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/amitmaity/task_tracker_backend.git
```

Install the dependencies with composer install

```
cd attendance
composer install
```

Then install the drupal site and revert the config.
